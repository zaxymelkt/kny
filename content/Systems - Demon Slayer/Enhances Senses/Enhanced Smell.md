# Overview
An individual with enhanced smell possesses an extraordinarily acute sense of smell. Before training this ability, they are often recognised in their community for having an exceptionally strong olfactory sense. They are capable of detecting even the faintest odours and pinpointing their origins with remarkable precision across vast distances. This heightened sense of smell enables them to identify the Opening Thread, the brief hesitation in an opponent's movements that presents an opportunity to attack. Their olfactory acuity is so profound that they can comprehend their environment solely through scent.

Through their superior sense of smell, individuals with this ability can discern phenomena beyond the typical sensory range, including the intentions, emotions, and thoughts of others, extending even to animals such as insects and birds. They possess the capability to detect the aura and presence of supernatural entities, such as demons, and can instantly gauge their power levels based on the intensity and unpleasantness of their odour.
