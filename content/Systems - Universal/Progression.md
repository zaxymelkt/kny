# Events 
Events will be hosted on the following schedule:

- [[#Side Arc]] - 1st Week
- [[#Mission Arc]] - 2nd Week
- [[#Main Arc]] - 3rd Week
- [[#Break]] - 4th Week

This order will be repeated until the end of the story.

## Player Hosted 
Player hosted events are done between two or more players. While there is not minimal or maximum length the roleplay must be, it is recommended to tell a full story with a proper and clear beginning, middle, and end.

While these RPs will not be graded; they will be read over and summarised for the wiki. If you wish for the last memory of a character to be the "Animal Game", be my guest.

To be awarded [[#Stat Points]] or [[#Talent Points]] the player must have completed at least 2 [[#Player Hosted]] events between the start of the week (Sunday) and end of the week (Saturday).

Rewards for Player Hosted events will be distributed to a player's [[Character Sheet]] every Monday. 
## Side Arc 
Side Arcs are events pertaining to exploring the world's history and discovering the secrets that lay. Side Arcs generally include 2-3 players. These events will play an important roll on discovering the methods of defeating [[The Demon King]]. 

To be awarded [[#Stat Points]] or [[#Talent Points]] the player must have played during the event for at least 40% of the [[Combat System#Turns|turn]] duration.
