# Combat System Overviews

## Turns

Turns can be broken down into [[#Time]] and the [[#Actions]] contained within that time.

### Time

Depending on the action, there is an increased level of complexity it may bring. [[#Basic Actions]] are the easiest to understand and use. [[#Moderate Actions]] require more in-depth planning and time-control. [[#Advanced Actions]] allow for things like Breathing Form interruption.

- There are 6 seconds (s) in a turn.
- These 6 Seconds can be broken up into various actions.

#### Moderate Actions

##### Injuries

[[Injuries]] are used to define the damage a character physically takes or deals. Injuries are given [[Status Effects]] to simplify the affect they have on an individual.

For [[Demons]], Injuries of different levels require a various amount of time to recover through [[Regeneration]]. Not all demons have access to high speed regeneration, making them easily susceptible to being neutralised by certain injuries.

##### Status Effects

[[Status Effects]] are used to give [[Statistics|statistical]] buffs or debuffs depending on the level of the status effect. Nearly all [[Injuries]] and [[Demon Blood Arts]] contain some type of status effect.

##### Breath Form

Depending on the Breathing technique used, the amount of time consumed will vary on the particular breathing form used.
