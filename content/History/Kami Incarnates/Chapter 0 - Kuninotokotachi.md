# Jomon Period 
Kuninotokotachi was born from the sickly echos of humanity; a cry for power by the greater kami. Given flesh of a demon, his [[Demon Blood Arts|Demon Blood Art]], [[Kamisama]], he was entrapped within amber one hundred years — listening to the cries of the people.

	"Give us a good harvest"

His bleed leaked from the amber — allowing [[Chapter -1 - Takeminakata|Takeminakata]] to prosper. His offerings reaped his blood back; every drop of his for 100 litres of theirs.
