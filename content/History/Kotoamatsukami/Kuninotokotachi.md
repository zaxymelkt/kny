# Jomon Period
[ 13,000 BC to 300 BC ] 
In the ancient times of Japan, during the Jomon Period, civilization was still forming. This era was marked by deep connections with nature and spiritual beliefs. People believed in [[Demons|kami]], spirits that could be either kind or malevolent, and who influenced both the fate of humans and the natural world.

One significant figure of this time was [[Kuninotokotachi]], a being created from the collective hopes and fears of the Jomon people. He symbolized their desire for control and prosperity. Kuninotokotachi’s story began with a century of isolation, where he was trapped within amber. This exile mirrored the societal practice of setting apart those seen as sacred or dangerous, allowing him to deeply understand the pain and suffering of his people.

Kuninotokotachi had a unique ability known as [[Demon Blood Art]], Kamisama, which he used to create powerful beings called the [[Kotoamatsukami]] through human sacrifices. The Kotoamatsukami were:

1. [[Amenominakanushi]]
2. [[Takamimusubi]]
3. [[Kamimusubi]]

These three demons played important roles in the Jomon society. They were embodiments of different aspects of life and nature, each influencing the world in their own way.

## Roles of the Kotoamatsukami

1. **[[Amenominakanushi]]**: This demon represented the sky and the heavens. Amenominakanushi was believed to control the weather, bringing rain for crops or storms as a form of punishment. The Jomon people would offer prayers and sacrifices to appease this powerful spirit, hoping for good harvests and protection from natural disasters.
    
2. **[[Takamimusubi]]**: Symbolizing growth and prosperity, Takamimusubi was associated with the earth and agriculture. This demon ensured the fertility of the land and the abundance of food. The Jomon people depended on Takamimusubi’s favor for their survival, performing rituals to ensure bountiful crops and the health of their communities.
    
3. **[[Kamimusubi]]**: This demon was linked to life and creation. Kamimusubi was believed to have the power to heal and bring forth new life. The Jomon people revered this spirit, seeking its blessings for childbirth, health, and overall well-being.
    

The Kotoamatsukami, created through the [[Demon Blood Art]] of Kuninotokotachi, were not just figures of fear but also of reverence. They embodied the intricate relationship between humans and their environment, guiding the Jomon people through their daily lives and ensuring the harmony of their community with the natural world.
