# Yayoi Period 
[ 300 BC to 250 AD ]

## Conflict Amongst the Kotoamatsukami

During the Yayoi Period, the [[Kotoamatsukami]] began to experience conflicts amongst themselves. These powerful beings, created by [[Kuninotokotachi]], found their differing influences and domains clashing. This period of turmoil reflected in the natural world, leading to changes in the environment and disturbances in human societies.

## Flourishing Izanagi and Izanami
The deities [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] continued to play crucial roles during the Yayoi Period. They were revered for their creation of the islands and their influence over life and death. Despite the conflicts among the Kotoamatsukami, Izanagi and Izanami remained central to the spiritual beliefs of the people.

## Amaterasu's Visit 

Amidst this conflict, a significant figure emerged: [[Amaterasu]]. Born with a [[Demon Slayer Mark]], she possessed extraordinary abilities. She could see into the [[Transparent World]], perceiving the true nature of beings and the flow of energy around her. Amaterasu was always in the [[Selfless State]], embodying purity and selflessness.

## Wars and Conflicts Among Humans

The Yayoi Period was also marked by increased conflicts among human societies. As agricultural practices spread and communities grew, competition for resources intensified. The spiritual turmoil among the [[Kotoamatsukami]] mirrored these earthly conflicts, with different tribes and clans vying for dominance.

### Human Impact

The influence of the [[Kotoamatsukami]] was evident in these human struggles. Communities sought the favour of different deities, performing rituals and sacrifices to gain their support. The wars and conflicts among humans were seen as reflections of the divine discord, with people believing that their successes and failures were directly tied to the will of the gods.

### Spiritual Practices

Despite the turmoil, this period also saw the development of more sophisticated spiritual practices. The teachings of [[Amaterasu]] were integrated into daily life, guiding moral conduct and social order. The ability of Amaterasu to perceive the [[Transparent World]] and her perpetual [[Selfless State]] became ideals for the people to aspire to, fostering a deeper connection with the divine.

# Kofun Period 
[ 250 AD to 538 AD ]

The Kofun Period marked a significant transformation in ancient Japan. During this time, large keyhole-shaped tombs, or kofun, were constructed, symbolising the emergence of powerful rulers and the unification of various clans under centralised authority.

### Consolidation of Power

The conflicts among the [[Kotoamatsukami]] during the Yayoi Period had profound impacts on the human world. As the divine beings struggled, human societies sought stability through consolidation of power. Strong leaders emerged, claiming divine right to rule, and began uniting smaller tribes and communities into larger, more centralised states.

### Divine Intervention and Human Governance

The influence of [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] persisted as central figures in the spiritual life of the people. Their roles as creators and stabilizers were invoked by the new rulers to legitimize their authority. Rituals and ceremonies dedicated to these deities were held to ensure the continued favor of the gods and the prosperity of the land.

### Amaterasu's Legacy

The legacy of [[Amaterasu]], the incarnation born during the Yayoi Period, continued to resonate. Her ability to see into the [[Transparent World]] and her perpetual [[Selfless State]] were revered by the rulers of the Kofun Period. Temples and shrines dedicated to Amaterasu became centers of spiritual and political power, where rulers sought her guidance and blessings.

## Conflict and Resolution Among the Kotoamatsukami

The Kotoamatsukami, still divided by their differences, continued to influence the world. Their conflicts occasionally manifested in natural disasters, such as earthquakes and storms, which were interpreted as signs of divine displeasure or struggles among the gods. The rulers of the Kofun Period took these events seriously, performing elaborate rituals to appease the Kotoamatsukami and restore balance.

### The Role of Amenominakanushi, Takamimusubi, and Kamimusubi

- **[[Amenominakanushi]]**: As the supreme ruler of the heavens, Amenominakanushi's influence was invoked by the emperors to legitimize their rule. His authority was seen as the ultimate source of their power, and his favor was essential for maintaining cosmic order.
  
- **[[Takamimusubi]]**: Representing creation and growth, Takamimusubi's blessings were sought for agricultural prosperity and the fertility of the land. Festivals and ceremonies dedicated to Takamimusubi ensured bountiful harvests and the well-being of the people.
  
- **[[Kamimusubi]]**: As the god of spiritual power and transformation, Kamimusubi's teachings were integrated into the moral and ethical frameworks of society. His guidance was crucial for spiritual growth and maintaining harmony within the community.

## Human Wars and the Divine Struggles

Human conflicts continued during the Kofun Period. As powerful clans vied for control, battles and wars erupted. These conflicts were seen as reflections of the celestial battles, with each side claiming the support of different deities.

### Spiritual Practices and Social Order

The rulers of the Kofun Period used spiritual practices to maintain social order and justify their authority. They performed rituals to honor the [[Kotoamatsukami]] and sought their favor in times of war and peace. The teachings of [[Amaterasu]] were particularly influential, guiding rulers in the principles of selflessness and divine insight.

### The Construction of Kofun

The construction of large tombs, or kofun, became a significant practice during this period. These tombs were built for the powerful rulers and were believed to ensure their continued influence in the afterlife. The kofun symbolized the divine connection of the rulers, emphasizing their role as intermediaries between the gods and the people.

# Asuka Period 
[ 538 AD to 710 AD ]

## Return of Amaterasu

In the Asuka Period, the ancient land witnessed the miraculous return of [[Amaterasu]]. This incarnation was a child born with a [[Demon Slayer Mark]], possessing the same abilities to see into the [[Transparent World]] and maintain a constant [[Selfless State]]. Unlike her previous incarnation, this Amaterasu was even more talented, showing exceptional prowess and wisdom from a young age, creating the first breathing style, [[Sun Breathing]].

### Discovery of Nichirin

Amaterasu during her travels discovered a blacksmithing village, [[Swordsmith Village - Sakai]] which had a groundbreaking discovery. They unearthed a rare metal, [[Nichirin]], which possessed the unique capability of killing the so-called deities. This metal became central to her efforts in combating the malevolent forces that plagued the world.

### Weakness of Demons

Through the [[Transparent World]], Amaterasu realised that the [[demons]] created by [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] were vulnerable to sunlight.

### Development of Breathing Techniques

Amaterasu's talents led her to develop the first versions of [[Total Concentration Breathing]] and [[Sun Breathing]]. These techniques harnessed the power of breath to enhance physical abilities and visualise the power of the sun. Amaterasu meticulously documented these techniques, creating scrolls that she concealed as the [[Sun Breathing|Hinokami Kagura Dance]], a ritual dance that she would give to [[Kamado Techikimi]] to inherit.

## Fall of the Kotoamatsukami

The Asuka Period also marked the decline of the once-powerful [[Kotoamatsukami]]. Each member of this divine trio confronted Amaterasu, leading to epic battles that would determine the fate of the land.

### Battles with Amaterasu

Amaterasu, joined by her steadfast ally [[Kamado Techikimi]], faced the Kotoamatsukami in a series of fierce confrontations. Despite their immense power, each member of the Kotoamatsukami ultimately fell to Amaterasu's might and strategic prowess.

- **[[Amenominakanushi]]**: The supreme ruler of the heavens wielded the ability to cast an inescapable illusion through reciting a poem and expending his blood. However, Amaterasu's keen insight into the [[Transparent World]] allowed her to see through the illusion, and with the help of Nichirin, she was able to defeat him.
    
- **[[Takamimusubi]]**: Takamimusubi used his blood to create and control plants that feasted on blood and grew rapidly from any surface. Amaterasu, with her mastery of [[Sun Breathing]], burned through the deadly flora, ultimately slaying Takamimusubi and ending his reign of terror.
    
- **[[Kamimusubi]]**: Kamimusubi had the ability to create a replica, known as a Blood Puppet, of anyone he consumed. This ability to mirror his opponents made him a formidable adversary. However, Amaterasu's [[Total Concentration Breathing]] and [[Combat System|combat]] skills enabled her to outmanoeuvre and destroy both Kamimusubi and his replicas.

### Preservation of Knowledge

After the fall of the Kotoamatsukami, Amaterasu and [[Kamado Techikimi]] worked tirelessly to ensure that the knowledge and techniques developed during their battles would not be lost. The [[Hinokami Kagura Dance]] became a sacred ritual, and the scrolls hidden within it were preserved as invaluable treasures for future generations.
