# Emergence of Chance
[ 735 AD - 750 AD ]

Born at the beginning of the small pox pandemic, they were viewed as a blessing amongst their family. Believed to possess a strange marking due to their fight against small pox from birth — Amaterasu was isolated for their protection; and other's.

Amaterasu was born in the Nara Period of Japanese History, they were born to be a Demon Slayer. They were born able to see into the [[Transparent World]], and possessed a [[Demon Slayer Mark]] from conception.

Amaterasu would be told stories by the Fujiwara Clan, the threat of [[The Demon King]]. Villages rampaged and wars fuelled all due to this creature which birthed human-consuming monsters.

Amaterasu was a natural at combat — seemingly predicting every move they saw, even as a child. From the ripe age of 9, they bested their mentor. Amaterasu would go on to write the [[Thirteen Cycles]] depicting how to use what they would later develop into [[Sun Breathing]].
